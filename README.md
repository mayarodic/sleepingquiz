Sleep Quiz created to determine if you're getting enough sleep

Interactive Quiz or Tool 

Goal and Inspiration: 

For this last assignment I wanted to create an Interactive Quiz that centered around my target demographic. The target demographic that I chose were people that struggle with insomnia and sleeping. I personally identify with this group as throughout my young adult years I have struggled with falling asleep and maintaining a healthy lifestyle,  focusing on sleep and putting my health first. Additionally, I found it hard to determine that this pattern was unhealthy and that prioritizing sleep is very important. For this reason, I wanted to create a site that acted as a simple quiz which users could take to determine if they are getting enough sleep. If they werent, they would be directed to learn more and to techniques that could help them. 

Design Inspiration & Research: 

I initially started with doing research on sleep to determine what questions would be most important to be answered. I found that nearly 70 million Americans have a sleep disorder. This number shocked me as that only includes people who have been diagnosed. There are many others who find themselves experiencing symptoms and aren't diagnosed who aren't included in this statistic. When I was looking at websites that talked about sleep and acted as quizzes I found them to be very basic, therefore, I wanted to create a fun site that brought in fun design elements. As seen below in my initial idea I wanted there to be different colors, have it be bright and fun and overall seem more lighthearted instead of serious. I believe that information surrounding health can be scary, therefore, having a fun site hopefully makes this experience more fun. 

Sketching: 
My initial sketch is seen here. I wanted each question to be shown one after the other which the user could navigate through using buttons. My initial questions are listed below. 

Website: 
For my website I started off with creating a javascript code that acted as the primary quiz. For this section I referenced online tutorials and codes to create the foundation of the quiz. This included the different questions popping up, one after the other and creating a “right and wrong” answer. Following this, I wanted to add the element of tallying up the answers to then indicate if the user “Is getting enough sleep” or “Is not getting enough sleep”. This was done by using my “numCorrect” function - if the number is correct (in my case more B’s were answered) then it would direct for more sleep, the else statement then suggest the opposite if less B’s were answered. For my local storage I wanted to have the last score be stored and placed in the “About” page. This would be useful for users to come back to the quiz to see if they have improved on their score. I did this by creating a function called “showHistory” - this lets the history score be shown and stored. 

Challenges: 
Throughout this process I initially struggled with conceptualizing what I wanted to achieve. I wanted to have a quiz, yet include help. For this reason, the Learn More page was created to solve this problem. Ideally in the future I would like to add a tool that would give users the ability to choose another set of questions and find different resources such as: videos/audio books/meditation exercises. However, for the time being this page acts as an informational page with suggestions. Regarding challenges with my code, most involved local storage, I initially wasn’t able to have it work. Once I received help in class I noticed I was not placing it in the right function. Below are processed photos of codes that work and elements that didn't. 

Overall, I am happy with how this website turned out and how it works. I think that my goal of achieving a lighthearted quiz with good resources was successful. I definitely do see areas of improvement and things I would like to change. I usually like to stick to basic color pallets and I pushed to do something different, however, I would still like to make it more modern. I think adding a more bolded font and picking specific colors that work with the background could be a good starting point. Additionally, I really like my concept of having a tool attached to this quiz and I definitely see how it could be beneficial for users.
