        Lets Get Better Sleep!

            If you got a result that stated: “You need more sleep!” this page is for you!     
          <p class="text2">
            Sleep is very important and without a good nights rest it can be hard to go about your every day activities. Sleep allows for your mind to recharge and it leaves if you feeling refreshed and energized for when you wake up. Without enough sleep the brain cannot function properly. Here are some ways to help you get a better nights rest.          </p>
    
          <p class="intro"> 
            Try the Military Method: 
            <ul class = "list">
                <li>1.Lay down on your bed</li>
                <li>2.Beginning with your face, tense your muscles and then loosen them as you take deep, calming breaths </li>
                <li>3.Repeat this process down your body until you feel at ease</li>
                <li>4.Clear your mind. Then, picture a relaxing scenario like peacefully lying in a canoe on a calm lake or gently rocking back and forth in a completely dark room</li>
                <li>5.If this doesn’t work, repeat “don’t think” to yourself for 10 seconds and try again.</li>
              </ul>   
         <p class="back"> 
            The military method works better as you get more practice with it, so don’t give up if you have trouble clearing your mind right away. Over time, this technique should help you get to sleep in less and less time.

                <li>3.Breath in through your nose for four seconds</li>
                <li>4.Hold your breath for seven seconds</li>
                <li>5.Exhale for eight seconds </li>
                <li>6.Repeat this process at least four times</li>

         <p class="intro"> 
             Turn off your tech
         </p>

         <p class="back"> 
            If you’re not able to completely part with your devices for an hour before bed, consider turning down your tech instead. Try reducing screen time by:
            Listening to music
            Tuning on a podcast
            Playing an audiobook 
         </p>
